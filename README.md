# Measuring-Churn-Rates
Analyzing user churn rates with SQL and Python

Codeflix is a fictional company invented by Codeacademy (Thanks to Codeacademy for this project!). The goal of this project is to measure and compare the churn rates for the user segments. In order to figure out which segment of users Codeflix should focus on expanding, There are three important questions to answer:

1. Which months have enough information to calculate the churn rate?

2. What segments of users exist?

3. Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?

For presentations purposes, I have also uploaded an 8-slide ppt file in which you can have access. You will find more information on the results there.
I have used both SQL and Python for this project.
